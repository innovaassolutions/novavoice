          <Text fontSize="lg" color={bodyTextColor} mb={6}>
            Summit Roofing spent heavily on Google Ads and local SEO to drive inbound calls. It was working — they were getting 80-100 calls per week. The problem was what happened next. Every call went into the CRM as a lead. A salesperson drove to the property for an estimate. But nearly half of those leads turned out to be unqualified: homeowners on a $5,000 budget for a $15,000 roof replacement, renters who didn&apos;t own the property, people looking for a quick patch job when the roof needed a full tear-off, or callers who were just price-shopping with no intent to buy.

            The sales team was demoralized. They were driving across town for estimates that had no chance of closing. The owner, Mike, had tried adding qualification questions to their website form — but most leads still came through the phone, and his office manager didn&apos;t have time (or the training) to ask the right qualifying questions under pressure. She was answering, getting a name and address, and sending the lead straight into the pipeline.

            We built a NovaVoice agent for Summit Roofing with one specific mission: assess every caller&apos;s budget readiness and project fit before a single lead enters the CRM or a salesperson&apos;s calendar. Only qualified, budget-ready leads get passed through.

            Pre-Qualification That Feels Like a Conversation, Not an Interrogation
          </Heading>
          <Text fontSize="md" color={bodyTextColor} mb={6}>
            The key challenge was qualifying callers without making them feel like they&apos;re being screened out. Nobody wants to feel judged on the phone. Summit&apos;s NovaVoice agent was designed to gather qualification data through a helpful, consultative conversation — educating the caller about what their project might involve while naturally surfacing budget readiness.
          </Text>

          <List spacing={4} color={bodyTextColor} pl={2} mb={8}>
            <ListItem>
              <ListIcon as={CheckCircleIcon} color="#F25C05" />
              <b>Scope Assessment:</b> The agent asks about the project — what&apos;s happening with the roof, when they first noticed the issue, how old the roof is, square footage of the home, number of stories, and what material the current roof is. These aren&apos;t interrogation questions — they&apos;re what a knowledgeable estimator would ask. The answers tell the agent whether this is a repair, partial replacement, or full tear-off.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              <ListIcon as={CheckCircleIcon} color="#F25C05" />
              <b>Budget Readiness Assessment:</b> Rather than asking &quot;what&apos;s your budget?&quot; — which callers rarely answer honestly — the agent uses a consultative approach. Based on the scope, it provides a realistic range: &quot;For a full replacement on a 2,000 sq ft ranch with architectural shingles, most homeowners in your area are looking at $12,000 to $18,000. Does that align with what you were expecting?&quot; This naturally surfaces budget mismatches without putting the caller on the spot.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              <ListIcon as={CheckCircleIcon} color="#F25C05" />
              <b>Ownership &amp; Decision-Maker Verification:</b> The agent confirms the caller owns the property (not a renter), verifies they&apos;re the decision-maker (or that the other decision-maker is aligned), and checks whether they&apos;re working with insurance on a claim. Insurance jobs have different qualification criteria — the agent adjusts its questions accordingly.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              <ListIcon as={CheckCircleIcon} color="#F25C05" />
              <b>Timeline &amp; Intent Scoring:</b> &quot;When are you hoping to get this done?&quot; and &quot;Have you gotten any other estimates yet?&quot; tell the agent whether the caller is ready to move or just casually exploring. Combined with scope and budget alignment, the agent assigns a lead score: hot, warm, or cold.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              <ListIcon as={CheckCircleIcon} color="#F25C05" />
              <b>Conditional CRM Integration:</b> This is the key differentiator. Only leads that meet Summit&apos;s qualification criteria — budget-aligned, property owner, decision-maker, realistic timeline — are pushed into the CRM with a full lead profile. Unqualified callers are politely guided: &quot;Based on what you&apos;ve described, a full replacement may not be in scope right now — but I can note your information and we&apos;ll follow up if we have any promotions or financing options that might help.&quot; They&apos;re not rejected — they&apos;re deferred.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              <ListIcon as={CheckCircleIcon} color="#F25C05" />
              <b>Financing Awareness:</b> For callers who are budget-constrained but otherwise qualified, the agent can introduce Summit&apos;s financing options: &quot;We do work with financing partners who offer 12-month same-as-cash plans. Would you like me to include financing information when we schedule your estimate?&quot; This converts some &quot;cold&quot; leads into warm ones by addressing the budget objection.

For a 2,400 square foot two-story with architectural shingles, homeowners in your area typically see full replacement costs in the $14,000 to $20,000 range — depending on the complexity and any underlying damage.
